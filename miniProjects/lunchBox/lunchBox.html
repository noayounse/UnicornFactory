      <!-- INSERT PROJECT DESCRIPTION HERE -->
      Designed for the 'Pimp My Shipping Container' competition put on by the Brooklyn's Dekalb Market. The marketplace was under renovation and recycled shipping containers were to be used as temporary venues for artists, cooks, stores, etc. 
      <br>
      <br>

      We proposed a project that would attempt to use the community’s creativity to bridge the gap between interest and accessibility. The interactive experiment would be recorded over a period of 90 days, and distributed back into the community physically and digitally as a catalogued artifact upon completion. Instead of passively interacting with the those who stumble in, we wanted to generate a dynamic relationship between the public and the project in order to inspire others by example. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Daily questions would arise from current social, political, architectural and environmental issues. These questions would be posed to both the immediate and digital communities and available for input via wireless communication or physical drop-ins. Digital drawing boards, text posts, images, sound recordings etc. could all be used as potential outlets for a participant’s input. 
      <br>
      <br>

      The difference between this setup and that of a standard forum is that instead of prompting for feedback regarding an issue, we would seek creative solutions to resolve that issue. The hope was to activate the public by provoking them to start thinking about how they can start a change instead of why they cannot. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Given that the public has a limited opportunity to physically partake in this experiment during the work day, the hours of availability for social contribution, both digitally and physically, would be set to coordinate with lunch hour. 
      <br>
      <br>

      The responses each day would be processed and expressed digitally on the the exterior of the market from the box itself via an internal projection. A daily digital post would be created with the responses from the collective public and the final daily response, interpreted from those user inputs. 
      <br>
      <br>

      The Lunch Box would be situated in an elevated position, hereby allowing for a view out towards Brooklyn, as well as for a clear view of the digital projection from ground level. 
      <br>
      <br>

      In order to create a unique container in the midst of the other containers we decided to enhance the direct angle of the digital projection by bending the box over the edge of another container. This would be achieved by using a single angled slice and rotating the end of the box 180 degrees. Thereby, not loosing any material. 
      <br>
      <br>

      The unique form would force an alternative perspective for both the observer and the compiler - inducing a visual and mental connection between the two.
